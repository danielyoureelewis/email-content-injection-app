                    <strong>There was never supposed to be a store.</strong>
                    <br><br>
                    Not in the traditional sense. Not in the way that sane men mean when they speak of <em>commerce</em>. The Tentacle and Throw was not founded—it <em>manifested</em>, scrawled into reality by the twitching hands of sleepwalkers and shouted into being by the yawning mouths of empty voids.
                    <br><br>
                    We are not <em>entrepreneurs</em>. We are merely vessels—temporary meat-suits wrapped in questionable sweaters—through which the store continues to birth itself anew, each day more incoherent than the last.
                    <br><br>
                    Here, nestled between shifting dimensions and the back alley of a TJ Maxx, we offer things. Things that should not be. Throws that whisper. Candles that sweat. Coasters that remember your dreams. All curated with a discerning eye toward the <em>incomprehensible</em> and the <em>mildly decorative</em>.
                    <br><br>
                    Do not ask where our inventory comes from. Do not ask why it sometimes rearranges itself while you’re blinking. Do not ask why every third customer review is just the same phrase repeated in a long-dead language.
                    <br><br>
                    Instead, surrender to the strange. Buy a pillow. Offer it to the Thing in your walls. Tell it we sent you.
